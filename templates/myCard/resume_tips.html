          <h4 class="fw-bold">1. Look for keywords in the job postings</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 fw-normal pt-1">
            When planning to write a resume, the safest way to start is to closely read the work listings that concern you.
            When you apply for positions, read the job descriptions carefully for keywords that indicate what the boss is looking for in an ideal employee.
            Use such keywords in your resume as necessary.

          <h4 class="fw-bold">2. Review resume examples for your industry</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 fw-normal pt-1">
          When creating your resume, you might want to look at samples from your business for ideas and best practices.
          Although there are various ways to use resume samples, bear in mind that they are not supposed to be replicated precisely.
          If you can not use prototypes as a template, they will serve as examples of high-quality resumes in your field and work description.

      <div class="row py-3">

          <h4 class="fw-bold">3. Use a professional font</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 fw-normal pt-1">
           Since employers will have a short time to review your resume, it should be as succinct and easy to read as possible.
           Use a plain, clean font like Arial or Times New Roman. Maintain a font size of 10 to 12 points.
           Choosing a simple, understandable font will make your resume look more polished.

          <h4 class="fw-bold">4. Use active language</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 fw-normal pt-1">
            Your resume should be written usign active language, with no extraneous word.
            This involves using terms like "achieved", "earned", "completed", or "accomplished".
            If your resume is too lengthy or is difficult to read, try making sentences shorter or ideas more succinct.

      <div class="row py-3">
        <h4 class="fw-bold">5. Proofread and edit</h4>
        <div class="col-auto col-lg-8">
          <p class="fs-5 fw-normal pt-1">
            Before posting your resume, you must proofread it several times to ensure there are no spelling or grammar errors.
            Although there are many proofreading services and tools available, asking trustworthy friends to check your resume is also useful.
